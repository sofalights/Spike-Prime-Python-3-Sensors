# Spike-Prime-Python-3-Sensors
Python for 3 color sensor line tracing robot

left, middle, and right sensors are port b,d, and f respectively

left and right motors are e, f respectively

if using move motor (blue motor block equal in block based) for E SPECIFICALLY, reverse direction as the motor is flipped

color is black for the line, green for the turn indicator ( detect green on the left is an indicator for left, and vice-versa), red for line break (for wrg)-- or for end of trace(for RoboCup), white is background color

ultrasonic is for RoboCup (blayt, you should be using 2 sensors for RoboCup, the line ain't thick enough for 3)

this entire project is making better code based on the block version of the program. faster processing also hehe
